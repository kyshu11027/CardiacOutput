# CardiacOutput
Using Dye Dilution technique and MATLAB data to calculate and model cardiac output

This program uses the dye dilution technique as a way to measure cardiac output. Since the data is a concrete data, the integral approximations must be done using rectangular, trapezoidal, and Simpson's methods.
